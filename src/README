## SyncR

Time Machine in my mac is great, it really is. However, all it does is back stuff
up. I really wanted something that could sync my local music/video/photo libs
with the stuff on my NAS. I looked for some software, but everything seemed
overkill.

Then I remembered that my Mac is a Unix machine and has rsync, huzzah! I also
remembered that I needed to learn a wee bit of python - double huzzah.

Now, some may think that writing a wrapper for rsync is a fools errand and well
it might be, but it was a fun way to spend half hour.

-- Usage
Run it from the command line, or from a cron if you like.
%> ./syncr  - This will show you usage optiosn
%> ./syncr [source] [destination] [deleteDestFiles]

[deleteDestFiles]
This is tru rsync. If you delete a local file, then set this to 1, it will
delete the file on the destination location as well.

-- excludesFile.txt
If you want to exclude any type of file or folder, it that in here, examples are
.DS_Store
*.tmp

-- Warranties
None, if this buggers something up for you, then sorry, but I can't help. This
is provided as is with no warranties, you use this at your own risk (but, it's
just a wrapper!)
